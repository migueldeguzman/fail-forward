		<h3>Shape your failures and turn them into success building blocks</h3>

I got immersed in the trap of social media: posting and sharing the beauty of the island life, filming and uploading drone videos, the best sunset photos and meeting great and beautiful people, all of these are seemingly great indicators of a joyful life but unfortunately it was not and it's like a whack in the head of a baseball bat. I'm drinking alcohol almost everyday for a year and got my immune system to its lowest, resulting to a ton of skin diseases all over my body. It destroyed my confidence and altered my behavior. The chase for profits and recoginition became a reason for my "ultimate failure". I know how it feels to get lost and get stuck.

		<p>Your story is for sure different, but I am fortunate enough to have a chance to help you get "unstuck" through the methods I adapted to bring myself back to reality. Before I get to the details of, let's dive first on understanding why all of us fail in the first place.</p>
