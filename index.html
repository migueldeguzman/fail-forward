		<h1>Fail Forward</h1>
		<h3>Shape your failures and turn them into success building blocks</h3>
		<p>I want to help you get unstuck and move forward. Your failure have affected you and caused your mind to a memory loop of depression and forward intuition of what you might fail in the future. A lot of great people wasted their lives even at the peak of their successes doing the same thing. Anthony Bourdain, Chester Bennington, these are just two of the recent famous people who decided end their lives after going through depression. A lot of people are encountering this very problem now. Various reports show that suicide rates are <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&biw=1280&bih=539&tbm=nws&ei=-1ZtW62TCIv6rQHhw5-YDQ&q=suicide+rates+all+time+high+all+over+the+world&oq=suicide+rates+all+time+high+all+over+the+world&gs_l=psy-ab.3...344638.349264.0.349497.19.18.0.0.0.0.282.3070.0j9j6.15.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.1.195...33i10k1.0.ryuJQwjJOSQ">at all time high </a>all over the world.</p>
		<p>I am not a psychologist (I'm actually an Accountant) but I encountered depression and anxiety after failing my first business endeavor, I never felt it as a problem at first. I got immersed in the trap of social media: the beauty of the island life, filming & uploading drone videos, the best sunset photos, meeting great and beautiful people. I'm drinking alcohol almost everyday for a year and got my immune system to its lowest, resulting to a ton of skin diseases. My chase for profits and recoginition became a reason for my "ultimate failure". I know how it feels to get lost and get stuck. The experience of crashing and burning became essential to the concepts you are reading now.</p>
		<p>Your story is for sure different in all respects, but I am fortunate enough to have a chance to help you get "unstuck" through the methods I adapted to bring myself back to reality. Before I get to the details of how my method works, let's dive first on understanding why all of us fail</p>
