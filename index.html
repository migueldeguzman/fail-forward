		<h1>Fail Forward</h1>
		<h3>how to turn your failures into success building blocks</h3>
		<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to save lives. A lot of great people wasted their lives even at the peak of their successes. Anthony Bourdain, Chester Bennington, these are just two of the recent famous people who decided end their lives after going through depression. But in reality, A lot of people are encountering this very problem now. Various reports show that suicide rates all over the world are <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&biw=1280&bih=539&tbm=nws&ei=-1ZtW62TCIv6rQHhw5-YDQ&q=suicide+rates+all+time+high+all+over+the+world&oq=suicide+rates+all+time+high+all+over+the+world&gs_l=psy-ab.3...344638.349264.0.349497.19.18.0.0.0.0.282.3070.0j9j6.15.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.1.195...33i10k1.0.ryuJQwjJOSQ">at all time high</a>.</p>
		<p>I encountered depression and anxiety after failing my first business endeavor, I never felt it was a problem at first. I got immersed in the trap of social media: uploading sick drone videos, the best sunset photos, meeting great people. I was drinking alcohol almost everyday for a year and got my immune system to its lowest, resulting to a ton of skin diseases. My chase for profits and recoginition became foundational to my "ultimate failure" to-date. I know how it feels to get lost. The experience of crashing and burning became essential to my rebirth and it brought understanding the role of learning through our failures. This gave birth to this project.</a></p>
		<p>I want to help people accept their failures and move forward and turn them to success building blocks. I will help uncover the rationale on why we fail and go beyond it. Oftentimes our greatest version hides in our biggest mistakes and the moment we discover that we are of learning and adapting, the opportunities are endless.</p><br>
		<p>Now let's start with discovering the science behind it.</p>
