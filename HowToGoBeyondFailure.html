		<h1>Failure and Beyond</h1>
		<h3>Here is the solution and it's a tough one</h3>
		<p>
			I will not be easy and there will be no quick fix to changing your views in life. But there is a process geared to success and converting your failure as a foundation to a new YOU. It needs YOU to focus on accepting, acquiring new knowledge and creating transformational habits. Each of these broad areaas are subdivided more to specific topics. 
			<br>
			<br>			
			Acceptance:	
					<li>Understanding your problem and learning from it</li>
					<li>Ask yourself new questions</li>
					<li>Try to focus on what you have instead of what you don't have</li>
					<li>The gun in your head analogy</li>	
			<br>
			Acquire new knowledge:				
					<li>The concept of abundance</li>
					<li>Cultivating your desire to grow</li>
					<li>Try to focus on what you have instead of what you don't have</li>
					<li>Problem solving mindset</li>	
			<br>
			Creating transformational habits:				
					<li>Meditation</li>
					<li>Note taking</li>
					<li>Gratitude thinking</li>	
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			These steps that you need to take can become too overwhelming as I assume that you are new to the concepts. It may take you more time or fall back to procastinating and negative feedback loops doing the journey alone. A better way might be for you is to hire a success coach like me to guide you through this path. The strongest enemy is always ourselves and I encourage you to reflect on everything you have read on these topics that I provided and seek within you if you really want to try and figure out your situation, and help yourself become better.
