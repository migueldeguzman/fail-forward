		<h1>Smash Failure</h1>
		<h3>Here is the solution and it's a tough one</h3>
		<p>
			It will not be easy and there will be no quick fix to changing your views in life. But there is a process geared to success and converting your failure as a foundation to a new YOU. It needs YOU to focus on accepting, acquiring new knowledge and creating transformational habits. Each of these broad areaas are subdivided more to specific topics. 
			<br>
			<br>			
			Acceptance:
					<li>Embrace Reality and deal with it</li>
					<li>Understanding your problem and learning from it</li>
					<li>Ask yourself new questions</li>
					<li>The gun in your head analogy</li>	
			<br>
			Acquire new knowledge:
					<li>The role of past, present and future</li>
					<li>10x rule</li>
					<li>Abundance</li>
					<li>Cultivating your desire to grow</li>
					<li>Problem solving mindset</li>	
			<br>
			Creating transformational habits:				
					<li>Meditation</li>
					<li>Note taking</li>
					<li>Gratitude thinking</li>
					<li>Getting Fit</li>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			By accepting your failure, mastering your transformational habits and cultivating the power of abundance, I'll guarantee you that a better version of you will transcend even to the people around you. You will set-up yourself for bigger challenges and even help other people get through their rough times (like what I'm doing now).
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>	 
			These steps that you need to take can become too overwhelming as I assume that you are new to the concepts. It may take you more time or fall back to procastinating and negative feedback loops doing the journey alone. The strongest enemy is always ourselves and I encourage you to reflect on everything you have read on these topics that I provided and seek within you if you really want to try and figure out your situation, and help yourself become better.
