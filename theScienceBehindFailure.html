		<h1>The reason behind failing</h1>
		<h2>Understanding how our brain works</h2><br>
		<p>It's essential that we define <b>what causes us humans to fail</b> before providing solutions. I want to guide you in an approach that focuses on understanding the problem FIRST before solving it. Once you understand that <em>we are wired genetically to fail </em>, it will unlock that part of you to thrive and dig more further. Yes, you heard me right! Genetically, we are built to create failure. This will make sense after finishing next two paragraphs.

		<p><b>Our brain creates <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=how+many+thoughts+per+day+our+brain+creates&rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&oq=how+many+thoughts+per+day+our+brain+creates&aqs=chrome..69i57.23294j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">50,000 to 70,000 thoughts everyday</a> and triggered by our emotions.</b>Receiving gifts triggers happiness, headache forces us to look medicine, friends sharing a sad story creates sadness or frustration. Thoughts and emotions are ALWAYS together to form action and one cannot exist alone. When you routinely remember an emotion and trigger a corresponding idea that translates to action it becomes a habit. Try to reflect on what you did yesterday or observe yourself today, did you focus on other people's opinion instead of your own? how many times did you complain? what emotions did you trigger? My questions are not to introduce negativity but rather try to confirm existence of it in your system.

		The fundamental flaw in our genetics is that our brain is not adapted to the modern world. Our ancestors used it thousands of years ago as a <b>protection mechanism<b> from tigers and dinosaurs and the same exist up until the world war I and II. We are using our ancestral brain to approach the modern world with fear, this is how we handle everything in the present. Based on recent <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns">scientific findings of Ray Kurtzweil in 2001</a>that our world will experience so much technological growth and it did happen but the problem is our primitive brain is not capable of adapting to it. Parenting will be more difficult. Depression will increase more and more. Why you are failing is embeded in us, it is not that you are incompetent or incapable of greatness, the world is just moving so fast that we are not wired genetically to adapt. This is why we ultimately fail.
