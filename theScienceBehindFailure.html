		<h1>The Science behind failure</h1>
		<h2>Understanding how our brain works</h2><br>
		<p>
			It's essential that we define what causes us humans to fail before providing solutions. I want to guide you in an approach that focuses on understanding the problem FIRST before solving it. Once you understand that we are wired genetically to fail, it will unlock that part of you to thrive and dig more further information. Yes, you heard me right! Genetically, we are built to create failure. This will make sense after finishing next two paragraphs.

			The problem is our brain is not adapted to the modern world. Our ancestors used it thousands of years ago as a "survival mechanism" starting from manuevering jungles with tigers and dinosaurs in the prehistoric era up to evading soldiers in world war II. We are using our ancestral brain to approach the modern world with fear, this is how we approach every problem in the present. Our brain creates <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=how+many+thoughts+per+day+our+brain+creates&rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&oq=how+many+thoughts+per+day+our+brain+creates&aqs=chrome..69i57.23294j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">50,000 to 70,000 thoughts everyday</a> and is triggered by different kinds emotions. When you receive a gift you feel happiness and satisfaction, hurting yourself causes you to feel pain, friends sharing a sad story creates sadness or frustration. Thoughts and emotions are ALWAYS together to form action and one cannot exist alone. When you routinely remember an emotion and trigger a corresponding idea and translates to action it becomes a habit. Try to reflect on what you did yesterday or observe yourself today, did you focus on other people's opinion instead of your own? how many times did you complain? what emotions did you trigger? My questions are not to introduce negativity but rather try to confirm existence of it in your system.

			Your parents and school grew your thinking based on fear as well. The article<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns">"Law of Accelerating Returns" by Ray Kurtzweil in 2001</a> explains that our world will experience drastic technological growth and what we see now is a reflection of this 17 year old article. The problem we face is our "primitive brain" is not capable of adapting to it. Parenting will be more difficult as there was no school to teach such. Depression will increase more and more. The reason your are failing is embeded in us and enhanced by technological advancements. It's not that you are incompetent or incapable of achieving greatness, the world is just moving too fast that we are not wired genetically to adapt. This is why we ultimately fail.

			But there is hope, a method to turn your failures and web of uncertainty and build your way to success. The mere fact that you took the time to step up and finish this material is a reflection of your strength and you believe that it is possible..
