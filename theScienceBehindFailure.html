		<h1>The Science Behind Failure</h1>
		<h2>How our brain works</h2><br>
		<p>	It is very essential that we define <b>what causes us to fail</b> before providing solutions. This ideas that I'm stating now fundamentally shifted my understanding and became more focused on building habits that will negate our human flaws because <em>we are wired to fail</em>. Yes, you heard me right! Genetically, we are built to create failure. This will make sense after finishing next two paragraphs. 
		</p>
		<p><b>The brain creates <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=how+many+thoughts+per+day+our+brain+creates&rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&oq=how+many+thoughts+per+day+our+brain+creates&aqs=chrome..69i57.23294j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">70,000 thoughts everyday</a> and are triggered by emotions.</b>Remembering a gift that we received triggers happiness, having a headache forces us to look medicine, whenever your friends shares a sad story feel that sadness or frustration. Thoughts and emotions are ALWAYS together to form action and one cannot exist alone. When you routinely remember an emotion and trigger a corresponding idea that translates to action it becomes a habit. Try to reflect on what you did yesterday or observe yourself today, did you focus on other people's opinion instead of your own? how many times did you complain? what emotions did you trigger? My questions are not to introduce negativity but rather try to confirm existence of it in your system.

		The fundamental flaw in our genetics is that our brain is not adapted to the present. Our ancestors used it thousands of years ago as a protection mechanism from tigers and dinosaurs up until the world war I and II. We are using our ancestral brain to approach the modern world with fear, this is how we handle everything in the present. Based on recent <a href="">scientific findings</a> our world will experience as much technological advancements in the years 2016 to 2022 as we have encountered in years 1900s to 2014<!-- check details --> and our primitive brain is not capable of adapting to it. Parenting will be more difficult. Depression will increase more and more. Why you are failing is embeded in us, it is not that you are incompetent or incapable of greatness, the world is just moving so fast that we are not wired genetically to adapt. This is why we ultimately fail.
